The following discussion takes place between a programmer that isn't familiar
with JavaScript, and our group, three 'competent' JavaScript programmers.

Throughout the discussion many code examples will be presented to you. Feel
free to edit the code. You can even run the code<foot>Note that statements,
e.g. declarations and assignments, will result in `undefined` return values.
Don't be alarmed when results differ from the predicted outcome, this has to
do with the parser, the code printer or sometimes even scoping issues.</foot>
by pressing the 'Evaluate' button above the code editor. Besides the
conventional shortcuts like <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> for undo,
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> evaluates the code example and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>r</kbd> resets the code example to its initial contents.

Although JavaScript is a small language, you can do a lot of things with it,
certainly when combining the small number of powerful features, without even
touching on the vast ecosystem. Browser-specific parts (HTML5, the DOM,
events, etc.), popular frameworks (jQuery, Prototype.js, etc.), community
practices (testing, code minimisation, etc.), and many other interesting
topics aren't covered.
