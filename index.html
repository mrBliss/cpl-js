    <h3 id="semantics">I. Semantics</h3>
<h4 id="object-oriented-programming">I.1. Object-oriented programming</h4>
<div class="question">I&rsquo;ve heard that JavaScript is an object-oriented language, could you expand on that?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Indeed, JavaScript is object-oriented. Typically, in object-oriented languages, everything is an object (e.g. Python, Scala, Ruby, Eiffel, &hellip;) In JavaScript this is not the case, there are both objects and primitives. The primitives in JS are numbers, strings, booleans, and the special types null and undefined. The objects include <code>Array</code>, <code>Function</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>RegExp</code>, <code>Error</code>, &hellip; This design decision, by many people considered a mistake, was carried over from Java.</p>
<h5 id="objects">I.1.1. Objects</h5>
<p>Objects in JavaScript are in fact containers of properties, where each property has a name and a value. By assigning a function to a property&rsquo;s value, one can add a method to the object. This demonstrates the importance of the presence of first-class functions. Objects in JavaScript can be compared with untyped hashmaps from strings to values from any kind, similar to Python&rsquo;s dicts, Ruby&rsquo;s hashes, &hellip; The name of a property can be any string, but the quotes can be dropped if the name of the property is a valid JavaScript identifier. The quotes are required when the property name is a reserved keyword, an empty string, or other strings not constituting valid JavaScript identifiers.</p>
<pre>var emptyObject = {};
var person = {
    name: &quot;Erin&quot;,
    age: 28,
    &quot;place-of-birth&quot;: &quot;Gibraltar&quot;, &#x2F;&#x2F; hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript identifiers
    walk: function () { return &quot;Do bi do ... walking, walking, walking&quot;; }
};</pre>
<p>Property lookup is done via the <code>.</code> notation. When the property name is not a valid JavaScript identifier, one has to use the bracket notation. Looking up a property of which the value is a function, just returns that function. To actually invoke it, terminate the expression with <code>()</code>.</p>
<pre>person.name; &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;Erin&quot;
person[&quot;place-of-birth&quot;]; &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;Gibraltar&quot;
person.walk; &#x2F;&#x2F; [Function]
person.walk(); &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;Do bi do ... walking, walking, walking&quot;</pre>
<p>This notation of objects is compact, easy to parse and parse, and has become a popular general data-interchange format, called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). TODO expand on JSON</p>
<p>JavaScript has no separate hash map type. Since objects function as hash maps, they are often (ab)used as hash maps. Conflating objects with hash maps can have some unwanted consequences, see the examples in <a href="#monkey-patching" class="ref">Monkey-patching</a>.<span class="footnote">The next JavaScript standard will contain a separate <code>Map</code> type.</span></p></div>
<div class="question">Object-oriented programming includes more than &ldquo;everything is an object&rdquo;. What about polymorphism, inheritance, etc.?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Of course, OOP is broader than &ldquo;everything is an object&rdquo;. Most definitions of object-oriented programming include features such as modularity, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, &hellip;</p>
<p>JavaScript has support most of them, but differs from other classical OO languages in the implementation of these features. Take for instance inheritance. Classical OO languages mostly feature a class-based inheritance mechanism, whereas JavaScript has prototype-based inheritance. JavaScript often has a different way of doing things compared to other languages, this will be a recurring theme.</p>
<h5 id="prototype-based-programming">I.1.2. Prototype-based programming</h5>
<div class="question">What entails prototype-based inheritance?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>A better term would be prototype-based programming, as inheritance is just one ingredient of this style of object-oriented programming. Prototype-based programming can easily be explained by comparing it with class-based programming.</p>
<p>In class-based programming, one defines <em>classes</em>. Each class consists of fields and methods. To use a class, one <em>instantiates</em> a new object of the class, which will have the fields and methods defined in the class. The values of the fields can differ from object to object. Let&rsquo;s make an analogy: the class is the blueprint of the car, and the objects are cars built from the blueprint. Now let&rsquo;s throw inheritance in the mix. One can define a class that inherits from another class. This new class will contain all the fields and methods of the parent class, but can add fields and methods, and can also override fields and methods.</p>
<p>In prototype-based programming, one defines <em>objects</em>. Each object will consist of fields and methods, or in JavaScript&rsquo;s case, <em>properties</em>. The whole concept of classes is removed from the equation. Instead of defining a blueprint to build new cars with, one just builds a car. But does this mean that we have to build every car from scratch, i.e. (re)define the fields and methods for every objects we want to use? No, to make a new object with the same fields and methods as another object, we <em>clone</em> the old object to get a new one. In other terms: we define a new object with the old object as <em>prototype</em>. Inheritance is also done via cloning, but after the cloning, the new object is extended with new fields and/or methods, and existing fields and/or methods can also be overriden. This new object can, in turn, be used as a prototype for other objects.</p>
<div class="question">Could you show how it&rsquo;s done in JavaScript?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>In JavaScript, objects can be created via object literals. In this case, <code>Object</code> will be their prototype.</p>
<pre>var o = {foo: &quot;bar&quot;};
&#x2F;&#x2F; Object.getPrototypeOf(x) returns the prototype of x
Object.getPrototypeOf(o); &#x2F;&#x2F; {}, which is an empty Object</pre>
<p>Another way to create objects in JavaScript, is via the <code>new</code> keyword, which you probably know from C++, Java, etc. The <code>new</code> keyword should be followed by a function call. The function after the <code>new</code> keyword is called the constructor. Objects created this way will have their constructor&rsquo;s prototype as their prototype.</p>
<pre>&#x2F;&#x2F; Car is a constructor
function Car(make) {
    this.make = make;
};
Object.getPrototypeOf(Car); &#x2F;&#x2F; [Function: Empty] is the prototype of a function
&#x2F;&#x2F; Define a new method for Car
Car.prototype.drive = function() {
    println(&quot;Vroom&quot;);
};
var myCar = new Car(&quot;BMW&quot;);
Object.getPrototypeOf(myCar); &#x2F;&#x2F; { drive: [Function] }, the prototype of Car</pre>
<p>Notice that the name of the constructor function is capitalized. This is a convention carried over from Java.</p>
<div class="question">If the naming is only a convention, how then differs a constructor from a regular function?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually, it&rsquo;s the use of <code>new</code> keyword that makes a regular function act like a constructor. By prepending this keyword to the function invocation, a couple of things happen, see <a href="#constructor-invocation" class="ref">Constructor invocation</a>.</p></div>
<div class="question">If methods are just properties that are functions, why don&rsquo;t you just define them in the constructor instead of defining them on the prototype? The latter seems more verbose.</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>If we were to define the methods in the constructor, copies of these methods would be created for every object created via the constructor. The methods defined on the prototype don&rsquo;t have to be copied, but are inherited.</p></div>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of inheritance in JavaScript.</p>
<pre>&#x2F;&#x2F; Create a new object that inherits from obj
function inherit(obj) {
    function f() {}; &#x2F;&#x2F; Dummy constructor
    &#x2F;&#x2F; The new object&#39;s prototype is obj
    f.prototype = obj;
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Make the new object
    return new f();
}
&#x2F;&#x2F; Create a new object from scratch
var a = {x: &quot;a&#39;s x&quot;};
&#x2F;&#x2F; Create a new object by cloning an existing object
var b = inherit(a);
&#x2F;&#x2F; Change the value of b&#39;s x property
b.x = &quot;b&#39;s x&quot;;
&#x2F;&#x2F; This change only affects b
a.x; &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;a&#39;s x&quot;
b.x; &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;b&#39;s x&quot;</pre></div>
<div class="question">What are the pros and cons of prototype-based programming?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Prototype-based programming gives the programmer more flexibility and freedom to define and redefine the fields and methods of objects dynamically. Instead of focusing on building a brittle taxonomy of classes, as in class-based programming, the focus lies on making a set of objects with the desired behaviour, reusing them via cloning, and modifying their behaviour when it&rsquo;s required. When building a taxonomy, it is often the case that some class at the bottom of the chain inherited some unwanted fields or methods, as it is not always possible to classify everything in a consistent taxonomy. Prototype-based programming gives you the freedom to clone and override the fields and methods of other objects at will.</p>
<p>For example, you have a bunch of <code>Cat</code> objects, but you want one of the cats, named Dexter, to make a different meow-sound. You can simply change the <code>meow</code> method of Dexter, a single <code>Cat</code> object, without affecting the others, or having to define a new subclass of <code>Cat</code>.</p>
<p>Having so much control over which fields and methods to <em>inherit</em> allows the programmer to do things not possible in class-based languages without language support, for instance traits can easily be emulated using prototype-based programming. Even classes can be and often are emulated.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s show you how to emulate classes using prototypes:</p>
<pre>function Car(make) {
    this.make = make;
};
Car.prototype.drive = function() {
    println(&quot;Vroom&quot;);
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; Constructor for the subclass SportsCar
function SportsCar(make) {
    this.make = make;
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; The prototype of SportsCar is a regular Car
SportsCar.prototype = new Car;
&#x2F;&#x2F; We change the constructor, because we inherited Car&#39;s constructor
SportsCar.prototype.constructor = SportsCar;
SportsCar.prototype.driveFast = function() {
    this.drive(); this.drive();
};

&#x2F;&#x2F; Instantiate a new SportsCar
var mySportsCar = new SportsCar(&quot;BMW&quot;);
mySportsCar.driveFast();
&#x2F;&#x2F; Vroom
&#x2F;&#x2F; Vroom</pre>
<p>The steps to create a subclass are often put together in a single function, allowing easy class-based inheritance.</p>
<p>Traits are also easy to emulate, although we don&rsquo;t have access to the super objects anymore. Abstract members can also be emulated, but will not be checked at compile-time for presence.</p>
<p>The methods are simply copied over from the trait object to the other object.</p>
<pre>&#x2F;&#x2F; The Trait we define
var HasTires = {
    tiresOk: true,
    puncture: function() {
        this.tiresOk = false;
    }
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; Add the properties of the trait to the prototype of obj
var mixin = function(obj, trait) {
    for (var prop in trait) {
        obj.prototype[prop] = trait[prop];
    }
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; We&#39;ll continue with the SportsCar defined above
mixin(SportsCar, HasTires);
&#x2F;&#x2F; The already defined mySportsCar now has the functionality defined in
&#x2F;&#x2F;  the HasTires trait
mySportsCar.puncture();
mySportsCar.tiresOk; &#x2F;&#x2F; false</pre>
<p>Of course, freedom comes with a price. One of the disadvantages are the slower field and method accesses/dispatches and to a lesser extend the memory overhead. Objects cloned from others object don&rsquo;t clone the fields and methods. It would be wasteful to clone this reusable data. Instead, the cloned object keeps track of its prototype. Whenever an inherited field or method of the new object, i.e. a field or method defined in the prototype (or a prototype of the prototype), is accessed, the new object delegates the call to the prototype. This delegation will go on until a definition is found in one of the ancestor prototypes. The longer this <em>chain</em> of prototypes, the costlier a field access or method call.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that it becomes harder to figure out which fields and methods an object has, and where they were defined. When using classes, knowing the class of an object is enough to know which fields and methods an object has (this, of course, includes looking at superclasses). A class functions as the type of the object, but in JavaScript, properties can be added and removed from objects at run-time.</p></div></div>
<h5 id="invoking-functions">I.1.3. Invoking functions</h5>
<p>In JavaScript, a function can be invoked in four different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a function</li>
<li>As a method</li>
<li>As a constructor</li>
<li>Indirectly through <code>call()</code> or <code>apply()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Functions can behave differently, depending on the kind of invocation. For instance the value of <code>this</code>, will be different. In JavaScript, as in most object-oriented languages, <code>this</code> is a special keyword inside the context of a function that refers the object of which the function is a method, i.e. the owner of the method.</p>
<h6 id="function-invocation">I.1.3.1. Function invocation</h6>
<p>Function invocation, is the regular kind of invocation, like you would call functions (or procedures) in C, Haskell, or Lisp, i.e. in a non-OO language.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}</pre>
<p>Functions that don&rsquo;t contain an explicit <code>return</code>-statement, will return <code>undefined</code>, JavaScript&rsquo;s <code>void</code>.</p>
<p>In the case of a regular function invocation, the value of <code>this</code> will be the global object. TODO refer to the global object, mention the omission of <code>var</code></p>
<h6 id="method-invocation">I.1.3.2. Method invocation</h6>
<p>A function is considered a method when it&rsquo;s the property of an object. The big difference between function and method invocation, is that in the case of method invocation, <code>this</code> will refer to the object on which the method is called, instead of the global object.</p>
<pre>function f() {
    return this.x;
}
&#x2F;&#x2F; Function invocation
var x = 1;
f(); &#x2F;&#x2F; 1
&#x2F;&#x2F; Method invocation
var o = {x: 2, f: f};
o.f(); &#x2F;&#x2F; 2</pre>
<h6 id="constructor-invocation">I.1.3.3. Constructor invocation</h6>
<p>When a function or method invocation is preceded by the <code>new</code> keyword, it is a constructor invocation.</p>
<p>A few things are different for constructor invocations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new object is created and will be accessible via <code>this</code>.</li>
<li>The prototype of the constructor function is stored as the prototype of the new object.</li>
<li>The newly created object is automatically returned at the end of the function call, no explicit <code>return</code> is required.</li>
<li>When the constructor has no parameters, the parentheses after the function name are optional. E.g. <code>new Object()</code> vs <code>new Object</code>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="question">So you&rsquo;re saying, every function can be invoked as a constructor? What is the point of that?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>TODO</p>
</div>
<h6 id="indirect-invocation">I.1.3.4. Indirect invocation</h6>
<p>The fourth and final kind of invocation, is indirect invocation. As <code>Function</code>s are also <code>Object</code>s in JavaScript, they can have methods. Two of the available methods of <code>Function</code>s are <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code>.<span class="footnote">For readers familiar with Common Lisp (or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp-1_vs._Lisp-2#The_function_namespace" target="_blank">Lisp-2</a> to be more precise), <code>call</code> is JavaScript&rsquo;s <code>funcall</code>. For readers familiar with any Lisp dialect, JavaScript&rsquo;s <code>apply</code> is similar to most Lisp&rsquo;s <code>apply</code>.</span></p>
<p>The <code>call</code> method is invoked on a function and takes at least one argument, the object to which <code>this</code> will refer in the context of the function. Extra arguments are passed to the function.</p>
<p>The <code>apply</code> method is invoked on a function and takes at least one argument, the object to which <code>this</code> will refer in the context of the function. The optional second argument should be an <code>Array</code>, holding arguments that will be to the function.</p>
<pre>
function f(x, y) {
    return [this, x, y];
}
f.call({a: &#39;foo&#39;},  1, 2); &#x2F;&#x2F; [ { a: &#39;foo&#39; }, 1, 2 ]
f.apply({a: &#39;foo&#39;}, [1, 2]); &#x2F;&#x2F; [ { a: &#39;foo&#39; }, 1, 2 ]</pre>
<div class="question">Can you give me a use case of these <code>call</code>- and <code>apply</code>-methods?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>A possible use case is the reuse of methods. Let&rsquo;s say we have an object (or a class) A with some methods. We also have some other, totally unrelated object B. There might be a method defined on A that we wish to invoke on B too, instead of copying the method from object A to object B, or making A B&rsquo;s prototype, we can simply invoke the method on object B.</p>
<p>Essentially, we bypass the inheritance tree, and are able to reuse methods defined for other objects.</p>
<pre>&#x2F;&#x2F; Object&#x2F;Class A
var Person = function(name) { this.name = name; };
Person.prototype.introduce = function() {
    return &quot;Hello, my name is &quot; + this.name;
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; Object B. We don&#39;t want B to inherit from A. We could add the
&#x2F;&#x2F; `introduce`-method as a property to B, but indirect invocation is much
&#x2F;&#x2F; cheaper that copying the method, and then performing a method
&#x2F;&#x2F; invocation.
var car = {name: &#39;Mater&#39;, town: &#39;Radiator Springs&#39;};
Person.prototype.introduce.call(car);</pre></div>
<h5 id="encapsulation">I.1.4. Encapsulation</h5>
<p>Another example of JavaScript&rsquo;s <em>exotic</em> way of doing things is encapsulation. Most classical OO languages support visibility modifiers to control the accessibility of fields and methods by other classes. In JavaScript, there are no such modifiers, but encapsulation is still achievable, via the use of closures.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="Java">class A {
    private int counter = 0;
    public void inc() {
        counter++;
    }
}
..
A a = new A();
a.inc(); &#x2F;&#x2F; OK
a.counter; &#x2F;&#x2F; Error: not visible!
..</pre>
<pre>var a = (function () {
    var counter = 0;
    return {
        inc: function() {
            counter++;
        },
    };
})();
a.inc(); &#x2F;&#x2F; OK
a.counter; &#x2F;&#x2F; Error: not visible!</pre>
<div class="question">What is a closure?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Before explaining what a closure is, you have to know some things about JavaScript&rsquo;s scoping rules.</p>
<h6 id="function-global-scope">I.1.4.1. Function & global scope</h6>
<p>JavaScript&rsquo;s scoping rules differ from common languages like C and Java. In C and Java, curly braces (<code>{&hellip;}</code>) delimit different scopes. The body of a function, a while-loop, a for-loop, a class (in the case of Java), all have a separate scope (known as <em>block scope</em>). In JavaScript, there are only two kinds of scope: the global scope and function scope.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see some examples of these differing scoping rules</p>
<pre class="Java">for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    &#x2F;&#x2F; ...
}
System.out.println(i); &#x2F;&#x2F; Error: i is undefined here,
&#x2F;&#x2F; it is only accessible within the scope of the for-loop

int a = 10;
{
    &#x2F;&#x2F; A new scope
    a = 3;
}
System.out.println(a); &#x2F;&#x2F; 10</pre>
<pre>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    &#x2F;&#x2F; ...
}
println(i); &#x2F;&#x2F; 10

var a = 10;
{
    &#x2F;&#x2F; No new scope
    a = 3;
}
println(a); &#x2F;&#x2F; 3</pre>
<p>By default all variables will be defined in the global scope, i.e. they will be global variables. This sends cold shivers down many a programmer&rsquo;s spine. The only way to delimit the scope of variable definitions is by wrapping them in a function.</p>
<pre>var x = 3;
(function() {
    var x = 10;
    &#x2F;&#x2F; x = 10
})(); &#x2F;&#x2F; This function is invoked immediately after definition
println(x); &#x2F;&#x2F; 3</pre>
<h6 id="variable-hoisting">I.1.4.2. Variable hoisting</h6>
<p>In this intermezzo, another peculiarity of JavaScript&rsquo;s scoping rules is introduced, <em>variable hoisting</em>.</p>
<pre>var f = function() {
    return y;
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; ...
var y = 3;
f(); &#x2F;&#x2F; 3</pre>
<p>In the example above, we define the function <code>f</code> which returns the value of the undefined variable <code>y</code> when called. A bit later in the program, but still in the same scope (global or function), we define the variable <code>y</code>. Finally, we invoke <code>f</code>, which returns <code>3</code>. Shouldn&rsquo;t the definition of <code>f</code> fail with an error message complaining about the undefined variable <code>y</code>? What actually happens, is that all variable declarations in the current scope are moved to the beginning of the scope. Only the declarations, not the initialisations.</p>
<p>What happens under the hood is the following:</p>
<pre>var f, y;
f = function() {
    return y;
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; ...
y = 3;
f(); &#x2F;&#x2F; 3</pre>
<p>In this case, some people might consider variable hoisting to be advantageous, but that&rsquo;s not always the case, see the following example:</p>
<pre>var x = 0;
function f() {
    println(&quot;A: &quot; + x);
    var x = 1;
    println(&quot;B: &quot; + x);
}
f();
&#x2F;&#x2F; A: undefined
&#x2F;&#x2F; B: 1</pre>
<p>Most programmers would expect the first <code>println</code>-statement to print out <code>A: 0</code>. What actually happens is the following:</p>
<pre>var x = 0;
function f() {
    var x; &#x2F;&#x2F; x is now declared, but uninitialised, i.e. `undefined`
    println(&quot;A: &quot; + x);
    x = 1;
    println(&quot;B: &quot; + x);
}
f();</pre>
<p>This phenomenon is called <em>variable hoisting</em>. The variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the scope, but the initialisations are left in place.</p>

<h6 id="lexical-dynamic-scope">I.1.4.3. Lexical & dynamic scope</h6>
<p>We assume you&rsquo;re already familiar with lexical and dynamic scoping, so we&rsquo;ll quickly glance over it.</p>
<p>In the case of lexical scoping, functions are invoked in the scope that was active during the definition of the function. In the case of dynamic scoping, functions are invoked in the scope active during the invocation of the function. Let&rsquo;s show difference with an example.</p>
<pre>var f = (function() {
    var z = &#39;lexical&#39;;
    return function() {
        return z;
    };
})();

var z = &#39;dynamic&#39;;
f(); &#x2F;&#x2F; &#39;lexical&#39; when lexically scoped,
     &#x2F;&#x2F; &#39;dynamic&#39; in the other case</pre>
<p>JavaScript is lexically scoped, as is Scheme, one of JavaScript&rsquo;s biggest influences TODO ref scheme. The return value of <code>f</code> in the example above will be &lsquo;lexical&rsquo;.</p>
<h6 id="closures">I.1.4.4. Closures</h6>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have another look of the example that we showed you to demonstrate encapsulation.</p>
<pre>var a = (function () {
    var counter = 0;
    return {
        inc: function() {
            counter++;
        },
    };
})();
a.inc(); &#x2F;&#x2F; OK
a.counter; &#x2F;&#x2F; Error: not visible!</pre>
<p>As JavaScript is lexically scoped, functions have to capture the scope that was active during their definition. Essentially, what happens is that all variables defined in a scope outside the defined function but referenced from within the scope of the function, known as <em>free variables</em>, have to be captured. In the example above, the function defined on line 4 references a variable <code>counter</code> (line 5), that was defined in another scope (line 2). The free variables are <em>closed</em>-over, they are <em>captured</em> by the closure. One can think of a closure as a pair of a function, i.e. code, and its environment, i.e. data.</p>
<p>Encapsulation can be achieved by defining the variables meant to be private in a function (scope) A, and defining a new function B within A, that references these variables. The closure of function B will capture these private variables. By holding onto function B, but discarding function (scope) A, only B will be able to access these private variable,<span class="footnote">Unless function B leaks them via its properties.</span> effectively achieving encapsulation.</p>
<p>The following example<span class="footnote">Taken from the <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html#for-loops" target="_blank">Dart Language Tour</a>.</span> demonstrates a common pitfall with closures (and scope) in JavaScript:</p>
<pre>var closures = [];
for (var i = 0; i &lt;= 1; i++) {
    var f = function() { println(i); } &#x2F;&#x2F; f will print i when invoked
    closures.push(f);
}
closures[0](); &#x2F;&#x2F; 2, why not 0?
closures[1](); &#x2F;&#x2F; 2, why not 1?</pre>
<p>What happens is that the <em>variable</em> is captured by the closure, not the <em>value</em> of the variable during the capture. Because JavaScript has no separate scope for the body of a for-loop, the variable <code>i</code> is in scope during the whole example. The for-loop stops when variable <code>i</code> is greater than <code>1</code>, i.e. <code>2</code>, this explains why both closures print the number <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to wrap the definition of <code>f</code> in another function which takes the variables that will be captured as arguments, effectively creating a new scope/closure, and invoking it immediately with the variable to capture as argument. Function arguments are passed by value, not by reference.</p>
<pre>var closures = [];
for (var i = 0; i &lt;= 1; i++) {
    var f = (function(i) {
        return function() {
            println(i);
        };})(i);
    closures.push(f);
}
closures[0](); &#x2F;&#x2F; 0
closures[1](); &#x2F;&#x2F; 1</pre></div>
<div class="question">What are the advantages of implementing encapsulation via closures?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Actually, one could call it <em>emulating</em> encapsulation via closures. Because of the absence of built-in encapsulation via visibility-modifiers, JavaScript programmers are required to implement encapsulation manually via closures. So one could call it a disadvantage of JavaScript, although some people argue against encapsulation.</p>
<p>With closures, the programmer has more control over encapsulation, but has to do more work to achieve it.</p>

<h5 id="polymorphism">I.1.5. Polymorphism</h5>
<p>Polymorphism in JavaScript is achieved through inheritance or duck typing.</p>

<blockquote>Duck-typing is a style of dynamic typing in which an object&rsquo;s methods and properties determine the valid semantics, rather than its inheritance from a particular class or implementation of a specific interface.<br><span class="cite">&mdash;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">Wikipedia on Duck typing</a></span></blockquote>
<p>In the example above, all objects have the required <code>makeNoise</code> function as a property, thus satisfy the required <em>semantics</em>.</p>
<div class="question">Which of the two is preferable, polymorphism through inheritance, or through duck typing?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>To obtain polymorphism through inheritance, you have to set up the inheritance relation, including boilerplate code (constructors, method prototypes, &hellip;). This requires more work from the programmer. The advantage of this approach is that the methods can be inherited from prototypes of objects, requiring less memory than storing a method for each object.</p>
<p>Not having to set up the inheritance relation, is one of advantages duck typing. It&rsquo;s sufficient to add the appropriate methods to the objects that will participate in this application of polymorphism.</p></div>
<div class="question">You mentioned that one can <em>override</em> a method in JavaScript, is it also possible to <em>overload</em> a method in JavaScript?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>To be clear, a method (or function) overloads another method if it has the same name, but differs in the number of arguments or the types of the expected arguments. The right method to call is chosen statically, at compile-time. Overloading is a feature typically present in statically typed languages. With JavaScript being a dynamically typed language, the compile-time resolution that determines which method to call is ruled out, as the types are not known in advance.</p>
<h5 id="function-arguments">I.1.6. Function arguments</h5>
<p>Overloading based on arity is possible in dynamically typed languages, but not in JavaScript. The reason being that JavaScript doesn&rsquo;t check whether a function is called with the correct number of arguments. JavaScript will happily allow you to call a function expecting two arguments with 0, 1, 2, 3, &hellip; arguments. Missing arguments will be <code>undefined</code>. JavaScript also allows you to access the excess arguments via the <code>arguments</code> object. The <code>arguments</code> object is a local variable accessible within all functions. It is similar to an Array, but not quite the same. The elements of <code>arguments</code> can be accessed, and it has the <code>length</code>-property, but the other methods available for <code>Array</code>s cannot be used on the <code>arguments</code> object. One can convert the <code>arguments</code> object to an actual array, by calling <code>Array</code>&rsquo;s <code>slice</code>-method on it, like so: <code>var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);</code>.<span class="footnote">The <code>slice</code>-method of <code>Array</code> copies the elements into a new array, it optionally takes start- and end-indices. See <a href="#indirect-invocation" class="ref">Indirect invocation</a> for more about the <code>call</code>-method.</span></p>
<div class="question">What&rsquo;s the point of this <code>arguments</code> object? And why isn&rsquo;t it a proper <code>Array</code>?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The <code>arguments</code> object allows the programmer to define methods expecting a variable number of arguments.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>&#x2F;&#x2F; Sums all its arguments. The argument list is empty, because we&#39;ll
&#x2F;&#x2F; use the arguments object.
function addAll() {
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    var total = 0;
    &#x2F;&#x2F; args.shift() removes the first element from the array, and
    &#x2F;&#x2F; returns that element.
    while (args.length &gt; 0) total += args.shift();
    return total;
}</pre>
<p>Even when expecting a fixed number of arguments, the programmer can benefit from access to the <code>arguments</code> object. For instance when implementing a decorator.</p>
<pre>function decorate(toDecorate, decorator) {
    return function() {
        &#x2F;&#x2F; Both the decorator and the function to decorate can be
        &#x2F;&#x2F; called with the same arguments.
        decorator.apply(null, arguments);
        return toDecorate.apply(null, arguments);
    };
};

function argsPrinter() {
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    println(&quot;Arguments: &quot; + args.join(&quot;, &quot;));
};

function add(x, y) { return x + y; };

decorate(add, argsPrinter)(1, 2);
&#x2F;&#x2F; Arguments: 1, 2
&#x2F;&#x2F; =&gt; 3</pre>
<p>The reason that the arguments object isn&rsquo;t a proper `Array´, is <em>probably</em> the following:</p>
<blockquote>The concept of the <code>arguments</code> object has been on the language since the very beginning, it&rsquo;s even described in the ECMAScript First Edition Standard. In that version of ECMAScript, the <code>Array.prototype</code> was really basic, array objects contained <em>only 4 methods</em>: <code>toString</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>reverse</code> and <code>sort</code>. I think that&rsquo;s one of the major reasons about they make <code>arguments</code> to inherit from <code>Object.prototype</code>, at that time those <code>Array</code> methods didn&rsquo;t look too <em>useful</em>. But the <code>Array.prototype</code> object was extended in the next versions of the standard, now on ES5, <code>Array</code> objects have methods such as <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, <code>every</code>, <code>some</code>, etc, that are <em>really powerful</em>. [&hellip;]<br><span class="cite">&mdash;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3242693">CMS's answer on StackOverflow</a></span></blockquote>
</div>
<p>JavaScript&rsquo;s loose call convention, and the presence of the <code>arguments</code> object allows the programmer to emulate overloading by doing the resolution at run-time.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="Java">void overloaded() { return &quot;No args&quot;; }
void overloaded(int x) { return &quot;A number&quot;; }
void overloaded(String x) { return &quot;A string&quot;; }
void overloaded(int x, String y) { return &quot;A number and a string&quot;; }</pre>
<pre>function overloaded(arg1, arg2) {
    &#x2F;&#x2F; One could also use an if-then-else construction
    switch (arguments.length) {
    case 0: return &quot;No args&quot;; break;
    case 1: switch (typeof(arg1)) {
            case &#39;number&#39;: return &quot;A number&quot;; break;
            case &#39;string&#39;: return &quot;A string&quot;; break;
            }
            break;
    case 2: if (typeof(arg1) == &#39;number&#39; &amp;&amp; typeof(arg2) == &#39;string&#39;)
                return &quot;A number and a string&quot;;
    }
}
&#x2F;&#x2F; Identical for the Java program
overloaded();
&#x2F;&#x2F; No args
overloaded(1);
&#x2F;&#x2F; A number
overloaded(&quot;foo&quot;);
&#x2F;&#x2F; A string
overloaded(1, &quot;foo&quot;);
&#x2F;&#x2F; A number and a string</pre>
<p>These <code>return</code>-statements could of course be replaced with different blocks of code, specific for each case.</p>
<p>Of course, doing this resolution at run-time has a negative impact on the performance.</p></div>
<h5 id="modularity">I.1.7. Modularity</h5>
<p>An important cornerstone of object-oriented programming is code reuse. In order to reuse code, it&rsquo;s helpful, or rather often, of paramount importance to organize code into modular components. We&rsquo;ll use the term <em>module</em> for such a modular component. Such modules should provide a clear interface of the offered functionality, as well as the required functionality.</p>
<p>Modules often function as a namespace, take for example a look at Java, where packages or classes act as modules.</p>
<p>Originally, JavaScript was intended to augment static web pages with little scripts, making the page more dynamic. JavaScript was designed with this goal in mind. Little scripts don&rsquo;t need namespaces, packages, or modules. They were often thrown together in a single file. As we saw in <a href="#function-global-scope" class="ref">Function & global scope</a>, variables and functions defined outside the context of a function, become global variables. Every script executed on a web page executes in the same context, the global object. This object is directly accessible via the <code>window</code> variable, the name of this object immediately reveals JavaScript tight coupling with the browser. All globals are properties of this <code>window</code> object.</p>
<pre>var x = 3;
x; &#x2F;&#x2F; 3
window.x; &#x2F;&#x2F; 3</pre>
<p>This global object is the default namespace. Imagine loading some third-party scripts, for example scripts that add ads to your website. They will be executed in the same context as your own scripts. They can call into your code, or override your functions when names conflict. Not only is the global object a problem in terms of namespacing and modularisation, it&rsquo;s also a security issue.</p>
<p>JavaScript has no concept of a module or any language features for namespacing. But, as we saw a couple of times already, JavaScript provides sufficient means to emulate them.</p>
<p>The construct we&rsquo;ll use to emulate a module is a closure (see <a href="#closures" class="ref">Closures</a>). Recall that we emulated <a href="#encapsulation" class="ref">Encapsulation</a> via closures. A closures provides us with two useful ingredients: <em>privacy</em> and <em>state</em>. We have control over the visibility of the variables declared in the scope of the closure, as well as their state.</p>
<p>By wrapping the code constituting the module in a closure, we prevent it from tainting the global namespace (TODO refer to omission of var).</p>
<pre>(function() {
    var x = 3;
    var _privateVar = 1;
    var f = function(a) { return a * a; };
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Here come other variables and function definitions
    &#x2F;&#x2F; ...
})();
f(x); &#x2F;&#x2F; ReferenceError: f is not defined</pre>
<p>Currently, the functionality of our module is only accessible inside the module. The next thing to do is to export the functionality so it can be used by other modules. This is accomplished by letting the closure return an object containing the exported variables and functions. This object acts as a namespace for the exported functionality of the module. These namespace can be nested, by embedding other namespace objects inside them.</p>
<pre>var myModule = (function() {
    var module = {};
    module.x = 3;
    var _privateVar = 1; &#x2F;&#x2F; Not exported
    module.f = function(a) { return a * a; };
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Here come other variables and function definitions
    &#x2F;&#x2F; ...
    return module;
})();
myModule.f(myModule.x); &#x2F;&#x2F; 9</pre>
<p>To use functionality from other modules, we just pass the module object as an argument to the closure.</p>
<pre>var otherModule = (function(m) {
    var module = {};
    module.f = function(a) { return m.f(a) * a; };
    return module;
})(myModule);
otherModule.f(myModule.x); &#x2F;&#x2F; 27</pre>
<p>This approach is also known as the <em>Module Pattern</em>.</p>
<p>In Node.js (TODO refer to Node.JS) employs a similar approach, albeit with less boilerplate code. There is a one-to-one mapping of files to modules. The code of every file are executed in a separate context, preventing them from tainting the global namespace. To actually export variables or functions, they have to be attached to <code>exports</code>-object. The <code>exports</code>-object is a free variable within the context of each file. To use the functionality of another module, one has to <code>require</code> the file containing the module. The result of this call to the <code>require</code>-function returns the <code>exports</code>-object of the corresponding module.</p>
<pre class="NodeJS">&#x2F;&#x2F; File a.js
var x = 3;
exports.f = function(a) { return x + a; };
&#x2F;&#x2F; File b.js
var a = require(&#39;a.js&#39;);
a.f(5); &#x2F;&#x2F; 8</pre></div>
<h4 id="dynamic-typing">I.2. Dynamic typing</h4>
<div class="question">What kind of typing discipline does JavaScript have?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Unlike for instance Java, a language people would believe to be akin to JavaScript when comparing their names, JavaScript isn&rsquo;t statically typed, but dynamically typed.</p>
<p>The types of <em>variables</em> aren&rsquo;t known at <em>compile</em>-time, but the types of the <em>values</em> are known at <em>run</em>-time. Programmers don&rsquo;t have to annotate functions and variables with types like in statically typed programs.<span class="footnote">In statically typed languages with <em>type inference</em>, e.g. ML, Haskell, &hellip; it is also not required to declare the types.</span></p>
<div class="question">Why did JavaScript&rsquo;s creator choose to make JavaScript dynamically typed?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>As mentioned before, JavaScript&rsquo;s creator, Brendan Eich, based JavaScript on Scheme, which is a dynamically typed language.</p>
<p>JavaScript was intended to be a quick and easy scripting language. Advocates of dynamic typing suggest that programmer productivity is increased, at least for small to medium size programs, when the programmer doesn&rsquo;t have to figure out the types when writing the program.</p>
<p>Even though static typing has many advantages, like better documentation, the elimination of type errors at runtime,<span class="footnote">Most (static) type systems are actually unsound and cannot guarantee a program is well-typed in all of the cases. For instance <em>casting</em> in Java and C is a totally unsafe operation. Even Haskell, a language with an advanced type system, has an unsafe function that bypasses the type system: <code>unsafePerformIO</code>.</span> correct auto completion of identifiers during development, &hellip; it would be very hard to make JavaScript statically typed.</p>
<p>The ability to extend (prototypes of) objects with new properties at run-time, the ability to change the prototype of an object at run-time, the way the <code>arguments</code>-object works, or even the <code>eval</code> function (TODO refer) will make a static type system for JavaScript very complicated, or in the case of <code>eval</code>, impossible.</p></div>
<h5 id="weak-typing">I.2.1. Weak typing</h5>
<p>JavaScript&rsquo;s type system is also <em>weakly</em> typed. The opposite of weak typing is, <em>strong</em> typing. In weakly typed programs, types can be implicitly converted to other types, whereas these conversion have to be done explicitly in strongly typed language.</p>
<p>An example will make it much clearer:</p>
<pre>&quot;12&quot; * 3; &#x2F;&#x2F; 36</pre>
<pre class="Java">&quot;12&quot; * 3; &#x2F;&#x2F; Type Error
Integer.parseInt(&quot;12&quot;) * 3; &#x2F;&#x2F; 36</pre>
<p>In the JavaScript example, <code>12</code>, a string, is implicitly converted to a number to be able to multiply it with <code>3</code>. In strongly typed languages, such as Java, the conversion of string to number has to be done explicitly.</p>
<div class="question">This looks like a useful feature to me, why aren&rsquo;t most languages weakly typed?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>In the example above, it indeed seems useful. This is not always the case. It&rsquo;s not always obvious when a conversion and which conversion will occur. Take the following example:</p>
<pre>(&#39;10&#39; - 1) * 2; &#x2F;&#x2F; 18 = 9 * 2
(&#39;10&#39; + 1) * 2; &#x2F;&#x2F; 202 = 101 * 2</pre>
<p><code>Object</code>s and <code>Array</code>s can also cause some odd interactions:</p>
<pre>[] + 1; &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;1&quot;
{} + 1; &#x2F;&#x2F; 1
[] + []; &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;&quot;
[] + {}; &#x2F;&#x2F; &quot;[object Object]&quot;
{} + []; &#x2F;&#x2F; 0
{} + {}; &#x2F;&#x2F; NaN</pre>

<p>TODO ^^ doesn&rsquo;t work properly in the browser</p>
<p>This is the downside of these conversions, you have to know when they will occur and which conversion will occur for which types. Looking at the examples, you will probably agree that these rules aren&rsquo;t really intuitive.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="equality">I.2.2. Equality</h5>
<p>Like most programming languages, JavaScript has a <code>==</code> operator to check whether two values are equal, its inverse, <code>!=</code> is also present. JavaScript also has another operator that checks whether two values are equal, <code>===</code>, and of course, its inverse, <code>!==</code>. The latter operator, <code>===</code>, is also called the <em>strict</em> equality or <em>identity</em> operator. The two operators define <em>equality</em> in a different manner.</p>
<p>The strict equality operator, <code>===</code>, compares two values as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the two values have different types, they are not equal.</li>
<li>If both values are <code>null</code> or both values are <code>undefined</code>, they are equal.</li>
<li>If both values are the boolean value <code>true</code> or both are the boolean value <code>false</code>, they are equal.</li>
<li>If one or both values is <code>NaN</code>, they are not equal. The <code>NaN</code> value is never equal to any other value, including itself! To check whether a value <code>x</code> is <code>NaN</code>, use <code>x !== x</code>. <code>NaN</code> is the only value of <code>x</code> for which this expression will be true.</li>
<li>If both values are numbers and have the same value, they are equal. If one value is <code>0</code> and the other is <code>-0</code>, they are also equal.</li>
<li>If both values are strings and contain exactly the same 16-bit values (see the sidebar in Text) in the same positions, they are equal. If the strings differ in length or content, they are not equal.</li>
<li>If both values refer to the same object, array, or function, they are equal. If they refer to different objects they are not equal, even if both objects have identical properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>The (non-strict) equality operator, <code>==</code>, compares two values as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the two values have the same type, test them for strict equality as described above. If they are strictly equal, they are equal. If they are not strictly equal, they are not equal.</li>
<li>If the two values do not have the same type, the <code>==</code> operator may still consider them equal. Use the following rules and type conversions to check for equality:</li>
<ul>
<li>If one value is <code>null</code> and the other is <code>undefined</code>, they are equal.</li>
<li>If one value is a number and the other is a string, convert the string to a number and try the comparison again, using the converted value.</li>
<li>If either value is <code>true</code>, convert it to <code>1</code> and try the comparison again. If either value is <code>false</code>, convert it to <code>0</code> and try the comparison again.</li>
<li>If one value is an object and the other is a number or string, convert the object to a primitive. An object is converted to a primitive value by either its <code>toString()</code> method or its <code>valueOf()</code> method. The built-in classes of core JavaScript attempt <code>valueOf()</code> conversion before <code>toString()</code> conversion, except for the <code>Date</code> class, which performs <code>toString()</code> conversion.</li>
<li>Any other combinations of values are not equal.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Most (object-oriented) languages have a special value, <code>null</code>, a.k.a. the <em>null pointer</em>, which is used to indicate the absence of a value. Whenever a variable is expected to be a pointer or an object, i.e. has a reference type, it can contain the <code>null</code> value, meaning that the variable has no value. This null pointer is the cause of many errors, as the programmer should verify whether a reference isn&rsquo;t a null pointer before using it.<span class="footnote">C.A.R. Hoare, the inventor of the null reference, calls it his &ldquo;billion-dollar mistake&rdquo;.</span><span class="footnote">A safer alternative is a nullable type, like Haskell&rsquo;s <code>Maybe</code> type or Scala&rsquo;s <code>Option</code> type.</span></p>
<p>Allowing null pointers in a language is commonly regarded as a source of problems. Of course, JavaScript can do better than this, it has two different special values that are essentially null pointers! The first one is <code>null</code>, the regular null pointer, which indicates the absence of a value. <code>null</code> is a special keyword in the JavaScript. The second one is <code>undefined</code> indicates that a value is not initialised, e.g. the value of missing parameters, undefined methods, missing properties of an <code>Object</code>, missing elements of an <code>Array</code>. In older versions of JavaScript <code>undefined</code> was a global value, which could even be changed! Changing the value of the global <code>undefined</code> value could break whole programs. Luckily, this mistake was corrected in later versions. The type of <code>null</code> is <code>object</code>, in a way, this makes sense, because <code>null</code> takes the place of an absent <code>object</code>. The type of <code>undefined</code> is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<div class="question">Why make a difference between these two? When a property is <code>undefined</code>, isn&rsquo;t it the same as the absence of the value of this property?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to conceive of a convincing argument for a separation between the two. Here&rsquo;s the one Douglas Crockford makes in <a href="#bib-8" class="ref"><span class="bib">8</span> JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>You might consider <code>undefined</code> to represent a system-level, unexpected, or error-like absence of value and <code>null</code> to represent program-level, normal, or expected absence of value. If you need to assign one of these values to a variable or property or pass one of these values to a function, <code>null</code> is almost always the right choice.<br><span class="cite">&mdash;<a href="#bib-8">Douglas Crockford</a></span></blockquote></div>
<h5 id="truthiness-and-falsiness">I.2.4. Truthiness and falsiness</h5>
<p>JavaScript has a <code>boolean</code> type of which there exist two values, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. These two values, or expressions that evaluate to one of them can be used as conditions of an if-statement, or any other <em>boolean context</em>.<span class="footnote">Expressions used as operands of a boolean operator are also in a boolean context, e.g. <code>1 && true == true</code>.</span> In JavaScript, values of all types can, not just boolean, can be used in a boolean context. All values can be converted to a boolean, depending on the <em>truthiness</em> or <em>falsiness</em> of the value. All values are considered to be <em>truthy</em>, including <code>Object</code>s, <code>Array</code>s, numbers, except for the following list of values which are <em>falsy</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>undefined</code></li>
<li><code>null</code></li>
<li><code>0</code></li>
<li><code>-0</code><span class="footnote">(TODO refer number representation) <code>0</code> is equal to <code>-0</code>! To distinguish between these two values, you can use the following tests: <code>1 / 0 == Infinity</code>, <code>1 / -0 == -Infinity</code>.</span></li>
<li><code>NaN</code></li>
<li><code>""</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of truthiness and falsiness comes from Lisp-like languages.</p>
<div class="question">Is this something one shouldn&rsquo;t rely on, such as these type conversions?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>This actually proves to be useful in most cases. With one check, you can quickly cover the most common edge cases. If you&rsquo;re working with strings or numbers, you still have to pay attention to <code>0</code> and <code>""</code>, see the following example:</p>
<pre>function g(x, y) {
    if (x &amp;&amp; y)
        return x + y;
    else
        return -1;
}
g(4, 5); &#x2F;&#x2F; 9
g(4, 0); &#x2F;&#x2F; -1</pre>
<p>The programmer could have had the following behaviour in mind when writing the function <code>g</code> in the example above: &ldquo;when both arguments are non-<code>null</code> and also not <code>undefined</code>, return the sum of them.&rdquo; This, of course, will not function correctly as <code>0</code>, a falsy number, will fail the check. You can see that it&rsquo;s easy to overlook this subtlety.</p></div></div>
<h4 id="functional-programming">I.3. Functional programming</h4>
<div class="question">You mentioned that JavaScript has first-class functions, does this mean that JavaScript is a functional language?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>It&rsquo;s true that nearly all, if not all, functional languages support first-class functions, but this alone doesn&rsquo;t make a language functional. Functional programming consists of more than just first-class functions, sometimes it&rsquo;s more about what you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do<span class="footnote">In Haskell, for example, you can&rsquo;t just change the value of a variable.</span>, or in some cases, what the default is.<span class="footnote">Immutable data structures are the default in Scala, but mutable ones are also available.</span></p>
<p>An important tenet of functional programming is the avoidance or isolation of side-effects. All forms of state are side-effects. In JavaScript, pretty much every accessible variable can be modified, effectively making the whole environment <em>stateful</em>. It&rsquo;s very common to define and change global variables, even by accident (TODO refer var keyword omission). The properties of objects are mutable by default, including the methods and the prototype. Just like Ruby, JavaScript is a very dynamic language, offering the programmer nearly maximum flexibility, at the cost of the omnipresent fragility of state.</p>
<h5 id="immutability">I.3.1. Immutability</h5>
<p>An important tool to minimize the presence of state in a program is the use of immutable data structures, instead of mutable ones, which are inherently stateful. Rather than modifying the data structure in-place, a new copy of the data structure is made with the desired modifications.<span class="footnote">Copying the whole data structure for every change is of course costly. Luckily, efficient immutable data structures exist, for example the <em>hash array mapped trie</em>, invented by the late Phill Bagwell. See <a href="#bib-14" class="ref"><span class="bib">14</span> Purely Functional Data Structures</a>, for more such data structures.</span></p>
<p>It might come as a surprise, but in JavaScript, properties can be made immutable. As you will see, this requires a lot more effort. This clearly indicates the language designer&rsquo;s intention, to discourage users from using the feature.</p>
<div class="question">How do you mean, &ldquo;This clearly indicates the language designer&rsquo;s intention, to discourage users from using the feature&rdquo;?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>When doing something in a particular way requires more code than in the default way, and thus more effort, programmers will not be inclined to make the extra effort, and will quickly fall back to the default way.</p></div>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to make a property mutable:</p>
<pre> var obj = {x: 1};
 &#x2F;&#x2F; Make obj&#39;s x property immutable
 Object.defineProperty(obj, &#39;x&#39;, {
     writable: false
 });
 obj.x = 3;
 obj.x; &#x2F;&#x2F; 1</pre>
<p>You can still assign a new value to the property, it just won&rsquo;t have any effect. Of course, this in now way comes close to Haskell&rsquo;s, Scala&rsquo;s or Clojure&rsquo;s immutable datastructures.</p>
<h5 id="higher-order-functions--recursion---lists">I.3.2. Higher-order functions, recursion & lists</h5>
<p>If there even was an accepted definition of functional programming, JavaScript probably wouldn&rsquo;t satisfy the requirements, but this won&rsquo;t prevent programmers from writing JavaScript programs in a functional style. Thanks to Scheme&rsquo;s influence, JavaScript is equipped with first-class functions, which allow the programmer to write some of the typical higher-order functions that are almost invariably present in a functional language.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: the following functions are in no way optimized or robust enough for general use, they just serve to illustrate programming in a functional style.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with some primitives, they should be familiar to programmers that have dabbled in Lisp or Haskell.</p>
<pre>&#x2F;&#x2F; Make a list with x as head and xs as tail
var cons = function(x, xs) {
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Make a copy of xs
    var xs2 = xs.slice(0);
    xs2.unshift(x);
    return xs2;
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; Return the first element of xs
var head = function(xs) {
    return xs[0];
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; Return all but the first element of xs
var tail = function(xs) {
    return xs.slice(1);
};
&#x2F;&#x2F; Return true when xs is an empty list
var isEmpty = function(xs) {
    return xs.length == 0;
};</pre>
<p>Using these primitives, we can easily define our first <em>higher-order function</em>. A higher-order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function. The function defined below, <code>map</code> takes two arguments: a function <code>f</code> and an array <code>xs</code>. <code>map</code> will apply <code>f</code> to every element in <code>xs</code> and return a new array containing the return values of these applications.</p>
<pre>var map = function(f, xs) {
    if (isEmpty(xs))
        return [];
    else
        return cons(f(head(xs)), map(f, tail(xs)));
};
map(function(x) { return x + 1; }, [1, 2, 3]); &#x2F;&#x2F; [2, 3, 4]</pre>
<p>The <code>map</code> function is defined recursively. Functional programmers prefer recursion to iteration, mostly because iteration involves loop indices, or some other form of state, but elegance also plays a role.</p>
<blockquote>To iterate is human, to recurse divine.<br><span class="cite">&mdash;L. Peter Deutsch</span></blockquote>
<div class="question">Doesn&rsquo;t recursion lead to stack overflow errors when it goes on for too long?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>That&rsquo;s true, recursion comes at a cost, namely the stack space that is consumed by the recursive function calls. When passed a very large list, the <code>map</code> function will exhaust the stack and cause a stack overflow error. The solution for this problem is <em>tail call optimisation</em>. When a language, or rather a language implementation, supports tail call optimisation, function calls in tail position<span class="footnote">A statement or expression is in tail position when it&rsquo;s the last thing to be executed or evaluated before the function returns.</span> are eliminated and replaced by jumps to the function, effectively transforming tail recursive programs<span class="footnote">The example above is actually not <em>tail</em> recursive, but could be made tail recursive, e.g. by the use of an accumulator.</span> into equivalent programs that use loops. Although the Scheme<span class="footnote">Remember that Scheme was one of the main influences on JavaScript.</span> standards require implementations to support tail call optimization, JavaScript standards don&rsquo;t require it.</p>
<p>Because of this lack of tail call optimisation, it&rsquo;s recommended to write programs using loops instead of recursion in JavaScript.</p></div>
<p>On the last line of the example above, you can see the <code>map</code> function in use: we increment each element of a list with one. You will probably have noticed that declaring the anonymous function that adds <code>1</code> to a value takes much space. Just to declare the simplest anonymous function, e.g. the identity function, takes at least 21 characters in JavaScript: <code>function(x){return x}</code>, compare this with, for example, Haskell: <code>\x->x</code>, only 5 characters! The unwieldiness of the <code>function</code> keyword is one of JavaScript&rsquo;s warts when it comes to writing programs using higher-order functions.</p>
<p>Version 1.6 of JavaScript provides a built-in <code>map</code> function declared on the prototype of <code>Array</code>:</p>
<pre>[1, 2, 3].map(function(x) { return x + 1; }); &#x2F;&#x2F; [2, 3, 4]</pre>
<p>In addition to <code>map</code>, <code>forEach</code>, <code>every</code>, <code>some</code>, and <code>filter</code> are also available. In even more recent versions of JavaScript, <code>reduce</code> and <code>reduceRight</code> are available. These will ring a bell with programmers with Haskell or Clojure experience. This demonstrates that functional programming, albeit in limited form, is slowly creeping into mainstream languages.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another example, the <code>partial</code> function. Invoking <code>partial</code> on a function <code>f</code> with a number of arguments will return a new function, let&rsquo;s call this function <code>g</code>. When <code>g</code> is invoked, the following things will happen: the original arguments are concatenated with the new arguments, and <code>f</code> is invoked with the concatenated arguments. Three elements come together in this example: prototypes, the <code>arguments</code> object and higher-order functions.</p>
<pre>Function.prototype.partial = function() {
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Capture this into f, so we can refer to it in the nested function
    &#x2F;&#x2F; definition, wherein this refers to the defined function.
    var f = this;
    return function () {
        var innerArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
        return f.apply(this, args.concat(innerArgs));
    };
};
function add(x, y) { return x + y; };
var inc = add.partial(1);
inc(2); &#x2F;&#x2F; 3</pre>
<p>The example was taken from <a href="#bib-17" class="ref"><span class="bib">17</span> Functional Programming in JavaScript</a>.</p>
<h5 id="libraries">I.3.3. Libraries</h5>
<p>As demonstrated in the previous section, programming in a functional style is certainly possible in JavaScript. Numerous programmers have discovered this and have even made libraries providing functions that promote programming in a functional style. Here are some interesting ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://underscorejs.org" target="_blank">Underscore.js</a></li>
<li><a href="http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/" target="_blank">Functional JavaScript</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gkz.github.com/prelude-ls/" target="_blank">prelude.ls</a></li>
</ul></div>
<h4 id="monkey-patching">I.4. Monkey-patching</h4>
<div class="question">When talking about JavaScript&rsquo;s dynamic nature, you said JavaScript was comparable to Ruby in this aspect. Does JavaScript also support monkey patching?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s also possible do monkey patching in JavaScript. In Ruby, classes can be modified at run-time. As seen in <a href="#prototype-based-programming" class="ref">Prototype-based programming</a>, JavaScript allows objects, and by consequence classes too,<span class="footnote">Remember that classes in JavaScript are emulated/implemented using objects.</span> to be modified at run-time. This is just the way JavaScript works (TODO refer to line-by-line execution).</p>
<p>Monkey patching is often used to modify the behaviour of third-party or even standard libraries without requiring access to their source. Fixing bugs in libraries, mocking test objects, changing the behaviour of a function to suit your program, extending objects with useful methods, &hellip; are all reasons to monkey patch.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, you can simply modify properties of objects. A more effective and also more radical approach is to modify the prototypes of objects.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s extend JavaScript&rsquo;s built-in object with some methods:</p>
<pre>&#x2F;&#x2F; Return the last element
Array.prototype.last = function() {
    return this[this.length - 1];
};
[1, 2, 3].last(); &#x2F;&#x2F; 3

&#x2F;&#x2F; Capitalize the string
String.prototype.capitalize = function() {
    var newStr = &#39;&#39;;
    if (this.length == 0)
        return newStr;

    newStr += this[0].toUpperCase();
    for (var i = 1; i &lt; this.length; i++)
        newStr += this[i].toLowerCase();

    return newStr;
};
&#39;brendan&#39;.capitalize(); &#x2F;&#x2F; &#39;Brendan&#39;

&#x2F;&#x2F; Merge two hash maps together in a new one
Object.prototype.merge = function(obj) {
    var newObj = {};
    for (var k in this) {
        newObj[k] = this[k];
    }
    for (var k in obj) {
        newObj[k] = obj[k];
    }
    return newObj;
};
({a: 1}).merge({b: 2}); &#x2F;&#x2F; { a: 1, b: 2, merge: [Function] }</pre>
<p>All the methods that we added with monkey patches are quite useful. They seem to work correctly except for the last one: the <code>merge</code> function appears to have sneaked in the hash map we got back after merging the two hash maps. How did this happen? By adding the <code>merge</code> method to the prototype of <code>Object</code>, the top of the inheritance chain, <em>every</em> object will inherit this property and thus have a <code>merge</code> property with as value the newly defined function. This is obviously an unintended side-effect.</p>
<p>It turns out that we can actually hide this <code>merge</code> property, by making it <em>un</em>enumerable.</p>
<pre>Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, &#39;merge&#39;, {
        enumerable: false
});
({a: 1}).merge({b: 2}); &#x2F;&#x2F; { a: 1, b: 2 }</pre>
<div class="question">The apparent problem seems to be solved by hiding the properties that were added as monkey patches. Are there any other drawbacks to monkey patching?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The common pitfalls of monkey patching still apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patching a method in a single place will affect the whole program, which can cause some unintended behaviour. However, it is possible to revert or remove the monkey patched methods after using them.<span class="footnote">Users familiar with Lisp macros will see in the example below a perfect opportunity for a <code>with-patches</code> macro. The application and removal and the patches should be put in a try- and a finally-clause respectively.</span></li>
</ul>
<pre>[1, 2, 3].last(); &#x2F;&#x2F; no method &#39;last&#39;
Array.prototype.last = function() {
    return this[this.length - 1];
};
[1, 2, 3].last(); &#x2F;&#x2F; 3
delete Array.prototype.last; &#x2F;&#x2F; the delete operator deletes a property
[1, 2, 3].last(); &#x2F;&#x2F; no method &#39;last&#39;</pre>
<ul>
<li>When a single method is monkey patched in two different places in your program, it&rsquo;s not always clear which monkey patch <em>wins</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Monkey patching third-party libraries or the built-in objects, will inevitably create discrepancies between the documented and the actual behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: <a href="#bib-30" class="ref"><span class="bib">30</span> Monkey patch</a></p>
<p>The example with the <code>merge</code> monkey patch is actually still not correct, consider the following case:</p>
<pre>({a: 1, merge: 3}).merge({b: 2});
&#x2F;&#x2F; TypeError: Property &#39;merge&#39; of object #&lt;Object&gt; is not a function</pre>
<p>Objects are the easiest way to emulate hash maps in JavaScript, but as soon as the prototype of <code>Object</code> is monkey patched, objects can no longer be used safely as hash maps. As you saw in the example above, keys with the same name as a monkey patched method will break the behaviour of the hash map and the monkey patched method.</p></div>
<div class="question">Given the pitfalls just listed, is monkey patching still encouraged in JavaScript or rather frowned upon?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>If done with care and for the right reasons, monkey patching is a defensible solution. Fixing a bug in a third-party library could be a valid reason, provided that the monkey patch will only be applied to faulty versions of the library.</p></div></div>
<p>TODO bad parts (eval, with, etc.), not semantics: multithreading, event-driven, execution engines (V8, JavaScriptCore: mention Ruby DSL), node.js, JavaScript as assembly of the web</p>
