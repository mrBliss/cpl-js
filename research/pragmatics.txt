Pragmatics - How are the constructs implemented? How efficient are they? What
design choices have been made and why? What combinations of features introduce
overhead?

* Implementation of Arrays
* Implementation of Objects
* All numbers are implemented as floats, there are no integers (mention JIT optimizations?)
* Strings are arrays of UTF-16 characters (like Java)
  No characters, only 1-element strings

run-time environment: JavaScript typically relies on a run-time environment
(e.g. in a web browser) to provide objects and methods by which scripts can
interact with "the outside world".

Different implementations (for different browsers/products) exist. Example: V8
javascript engine (used in google chrome, but can also independent,
server-side, javascript projects such as Node.js). This engine is written for
C and is highly optimized. Unlike other engines, it compiles javascript to
native machine code instead of interpreting it.
