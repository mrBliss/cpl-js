Underlying execution model - How are the statements in the language executed?
Is there a straightforward reading or is there a complex execution model?
Things to consider include the dispatch model for object-oriented language,
the order of evaluation for functional languages, or the computational model
underlying logic- and constraint-programming languages.

* Pretty typical, OO-like
* Discuss prototype chain for dispatching
* Mention JIT and browsers?
* Function arguments evaluated from left to right
