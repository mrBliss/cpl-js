* Socratic questioning:

Getting students to clarify their thinking
e.g., ‘Why do you say that?’, ‘Could you explain further?’

Challenging students about assumptions
e.g., ‘Is this always the case?’, ‘Why do you think that this assumption holds
here?’

Evidence as a basis for argument
e.g., ‘Why do you say that?’, ‘Is there reason to doubt this evidence?’

Alternative viewpoints and perspectives
e.g., ‘What is the counter argument for?’, ‘Can/did anyone see this another
way?’

Implications and consequences
e.g., ‘But if...happened, what else would result?’, ‘How does...affect...?’

Question the question
e.g., ‘Why do you think that I asked that question?’, ‘Why was that question
important?’, ‘Which of your questions turned out to be the most useful?’
