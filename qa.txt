Q: Which programming language are we talking about today?
A: JavaScript, the language of the Internet.

Q: Why do you call it the /language of the Internet/?
A: JavaScript is the primary programming language than can be used in a web
   browser. Whenever a site wants some client-side interactivity, JS is
   /the/ tool in the box for this task.

   Every web browser supports the execution of JavaScript. JavaScript is used
   by roughly 75% of all Internet websites [1].

Q: What do you mean by /client-side/?
A: Visiting a website involves two parties (or more), the visitor, i.e. the
   client, and the visited website, i.e. the server.

   First of all, the client requests a web page from the server. The server
   then generates or retrieves the page to be sent to the client. The
   generation of this page will be performed by a program, which, of course,
   is written in a certain programming language. Programming languages used to
   write the program on the server, commonly called `the web server', are
   called server-side languages.

   The second part of the interaction takes place in the browser of the
   client. After receiving and rendering the web page, the web page would
   remain completely static, were it not for client-side languages. Programs
   written in a client-side language are sent along with the page to the
   client and are executed in the browser when the page is loaded. They
   provide a means to change the web page on the fly or to interact with the
   user without requiring a new page to be loaded.

-- From here on, the answers are summarised, the questions should also be reordered

Q: Which other client-side languages are there?
A: list the others (incl. Flash, Java, SilverLight), but mention that JS is
   the most used.

Q: Why is JS the most popular?
A: Built into the browser, others require plugins, etc.

Q: You mentioned Java, glancing at the name, one can assume they are related.
   Is JS perhaps the scripting variant of Java?
A: Popular at the time, marketing, etc. See wikipedia

Q: Isn't there any similarity between JS and Java other than the confusingly
   connected names?
A: Syntax, ...

Q: So if Java is not the main inspiration for JS, is it some other language,
   or was JS a _completely new language_? (Rephrase last three words)
A: If one ignores the syntax and the object-oriented nature, JS is awfully
   similar to functional languages in the Lisp tradition, like for instance
   Scheme. As a matter of, Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, says that
   he was lured by Netscape promising him to make a Scheme for the browser
   [2]. A short time before, Brendan Eich had developed in an interest in the
   famous [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/][SICP] book, which presents the
   tremendous capabilities of a simple functional language, Scheme.

   The main influence of Scheme was the presence of first-class functions in
   JavaScript. Another similarity with Scheme is the small size of the
   language, a handful of built-in types, ...

   function-keyword is unwieldy...

   Mention Self for prototype based inheritance, see [2] for other things to mention.

Q: JS is a scripting language, what does it mean for a language to be a scripting language?
A: Lightweight interpreted language, see wikipedia.
